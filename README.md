XPlane_EGLG_Panshanger
======================

Panshanger Aerodrome (EGLG) scenery package for the [X-Plane flight simulator](http://www.x-plane.com).

This is my first attempt at an X-Plane scenery package, using only Sketchup, GIMP and WED.  Please be kind!  It covers my local airfield, which is home to the excellent [North London Flying School](http://www.northlondonflyingschool.com/).

Panshanger is located approximately 30km north of London, in the United Kingdom, and serves GA traffic on a single grass runway.  For more information about Panshanger Aerodrome, please see the [North London Flying School](http://www.northlondonflyingschool.com/) pages or [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panshanger_Aerodrome).
