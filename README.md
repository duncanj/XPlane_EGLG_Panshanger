XPlane_EGLG_Panshanger
======================

Panshanger Aerodrome (EGLG) scenery package for X-Plane flight simulator.

This is my first attempt at an X-Plane scenery package, using only Sketchup, GIMP and WED.  Please be nice!  It covers my local airfield, which is home to the excellent [North London Flying School](http://www.northlondonflyingschool.com/).
